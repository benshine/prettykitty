## a slideshow viewer for cat pics

I'm working on this as an exercise in life without jquery or css frameworks.
First I'm building it with a few jquery calls, but wrapping all jquery calls in my own
object. Once I have a bare-bones slideshow working, I'll swap out the jquery calls
with javascript I write myself against the built-in APIs.

The live app (still a work in progress!) is deployed to [heroku](https://prettykitty.herokuapp.com/)
